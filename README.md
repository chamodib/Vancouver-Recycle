# Vancouver E-Recycle Project

The Vancouver e-Recycling project was conducted with four other of my fellow classmates, and all of their efforts are reflected through this project. 

This was an initiative under the Go Green Vancouver umbrella, aimed to raise awareness around electronic waste dangers, and educate the general public on how to dispose their old electronics responsibly. The vision of the project was to raise awareness through an interactive, virtual reality (VR) documentary on the proper recycling of e-waste, which would lead to a “greener” Vancouver.

There were three main deliverables planned for this project, consisting of a five-minute VR
application and documentary, a showcase event for the documentary, and an event website that
had more information around our initiative. We were able to deliver on 100% of these planned
deliverables overall. Due to various issues that we will discuss in this report, some changes were
made to internal aspects of these deliverables in order to complete the project by the deadline.

The virtual reality documentary can be found here:
